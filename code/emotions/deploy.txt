arm movements

Motion-Based Expressions: Each emotion now has a dedicated function that creates a unique sequence of movements:

    ANGRY: Rapid up-and-down movements of both arms (3 repetitions)
    SURPRISED: Quick raise of both arms followed by a slight lower and hold
    HAPPY: Waving both arms up and down in a celebratory pattern
    CALM: Slow, gentle movements from middle to slightly down and back
    FEAR: Defensive position with a trembling effect
    DISGUSTED: One arm up, one down, with a pushing away motion
    CONFUSED: Alternating arm positions to simulate uncertainty
    SAD: Slow drooping of both arms from middle to down

Reset Function: After each emotion expression, the arms return to a neutral position (90Â° for both servos)
